# What is a KMZ?

## Introduction

Google Earth, ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Maps, Worldwind, Bing Maps, and other software use KMZ files. What exactly is a KMZ? A KMZ is simply a compressed version of KML file. It is essentially a ZIP archive that contains a KML file and other associtated resources (images, icons, etc.). This is extremely useful to know becuase KML is an XML format. I will explain what all of this means later.
