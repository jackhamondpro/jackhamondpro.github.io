# Projects

My projects page is divided into two parts:

* Technical Expertise
* Advanced Solutions

The technical expertise section will list projects that I have worked on, what I did, and general notes on the tasks I completed. The advanced solutions section will have demonstrations of costum scripts I have written or how I used specialized computer skills/knowledge to be more efficient and effective at work.

## Technical Expertise

## Advanced Solutions
