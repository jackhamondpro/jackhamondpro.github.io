# About Me

Hello, I'm **Jack Hamond**, an Engineering Technician in North Dakota. I enjoy spending time with my family, reading a good book, and enjoying cigars with friends. 

I started my education (2022) at the University of Mary in Bismarck, ND pursuing a degree in Civil Engineering. I got an internship that next Summer at [KLJ Engineering](https://kljeng.com/). I got married in December of my second year of college and I got hired full-time that Summer as an Engineering Technician. I am continuing to work for KLJ to this day. Since getting hired full-time, I have decided to finish my civil engineering degree online at UND. My daughter was born in October of 2024 and pusuing my degree online has allowed me to create a flexibile schedule so that I can manage my work, school, and personal life.

During my second semester at the University of Mary, I had a course that tought me some of the basic tools on Linux machines (sed, grep, awk, etc.). I was super impressed when my professor taught us how to get to the terminal&mdash;I felt like a true hacker. I can still remember the first time I typed "sudo apt update && sudo upgrade -y" and watched the local package index update and the upgrades load. Learning vim, the way computers work, and the power of automation of simple tasks made me want to learn and understand computers even more. Ever since that semester I have continued to "play with" and use computers in my personal life (managing my finances, automating the process of turning my school notes into beautiful pdfs, etc.).

While working as an intern, I realized there were certain repetitive tasks that were taking up tons of time. I knew that the tools I had learned in class could automate these tasks but I did not always know enough of the language/tool to figure things out. I began "working at home"; I would spend some time at home learning more about some of the tools I knew about. Further, I discovered new tools and ways to improve my scripts. I even wrote scripts to automate my scripts. I began to realize that having these skills was greatly beneficial to me in my career.

This all leads to me typing these words in a **markdown** file which uses **jekyll** to convert the markdown to **html**. Jekyll reads all of the files (**YAML**, **SCCS**, and **JavaScript**) in this **repository** which is hosted on **GitHub**. 

This website will act as a place for me to showcase some of the ways that I use my computer skills to be more efficient at work as well as a place for me put my skill, qualifications, etc.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. **What motivated you to pursue Civil Engineering?**
   **Answer**:
   My last two years of high school I began to take math seriously and found that I enjoyed it and was not too bad at it. I did not know what type of engineer I wanted to be, but I knew I should pursue engineering. Unsure of which to choose from&mdash;electrical, mechanical, or civil (or computer science)&mdash;I randomly decided on civil engineering. I really enjoyed the classes and just never had a reason to switch. 

### 2. **How do you balance working full-time with pursuing your degree?**
   **Answer**:
   Balancing a full-time job with studying has been a challenge, but it's also a rewarding experience. I prioritize time management, break tasks into smaller chunks, and stay organized. I leverage my skills in automation and scripting to simplify repetitive tasks, which frees up time for studying. Online learning has also given me the flexibility to learn at my own pace and integrate academic concepts with my daily work.

### 3. **What coding languages are you most comfortable with, and why?**
   **Answer**:
   I’m most comfortable with **[insert languages you are proficient in]** because they allow me to efficiently address problems I face in my work. For example, **[x]** is great for [specific use case], while **[y]** has proven effective for [specific use case]. I constantly seek to improve my knowledge of new programming languages and frameworks to stay adaptable in a rapidly evolving technical landscape.

### 4. **What types of automation projects have you worked on?**
   **Answer**:
   I’ve worked on several automation projects to improve my daily tasks, such as:
   - **Automating data analysis** using scripts that collect and process data from multiple sources.
   - **Streamlining reporting workflows** with Excel macros and VBA scripts to generate reports on a schedule.
   - **Automating system monitoring tasks** on my Linux machine using custom bash scripts.
   - **Integrating tools** that connect different software applications to eliminate manual data entry and reduce errors.

### 5. **How do you approach problem-solving in engineering?**
   **Answer**:
   My approach to problem-solving starts with clearly understanding the problem. I analyze the problem, break it down into manageable parts, and identify potential solutions using both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience. I often use my coding and automation skills to create tools or systems that simplify complex tasks. Iteration is key, so I test and refine my solutions until I find the most efficient outcome.

### 6. **What is the most challenging project you’ve worked on, and how did you handle it?**
   **Answer**:
   One of the most challenging projects I’ve worked on involved **[briefly describe the project]**. The challenge was **[specific challenge, e.g., time constraints, complex data analysis]**, but I handled it by breaking down the task into smaller components and automating certain processes to save time. I also leveraged my knowledge of **[mention any tools, languages, or frameworks used]** to solve the issue more efficiently. The project taught me the importance of adaptability and staying calm under pressure.

### 7. **How do you stay updated with new technologies in the engineering field?**
   **Answer**:
