# About Me

Hello, I'm **Jack Hamond**, an Engineering Technician in North Dakota. I enjoy spending time with my family, reading a good book, and enjoying cigars with friends. 

I started my education (2022) at the University of Mary in Bismarck, ND pursuing a degree in Civil Engineering. I got an internship that next Summer at [KLJ Engineering](https://kljeng.com/). I got married in December of my second year of college and I got hired full-time that Summer as an Engineering Technician. I am continuing to work for KLJ to this day. Since getting hired full-time, I have decided to finish my civil engineering degree online at UND. My daughter was born in October of 2024 and pusuing my degree online has allowed me to create a flexibile schedule so that I can manage my work, school, and personal life.

During my second semester at the University of Mary, I had a course that tought me some of the basic tools on Linux machines (sed, grep, awk, etc.). I was super impressed when my professor taught us how to get to the terminal&mdash;I felt like a true hacker. I can still remember the first time I typed "sudo apt update && sudo upgrade -y" and watched the local package index update and the upgrades load. Learning vim, the way computers work, and the power of automation of simple tasks made me want to learn and understand computers even more. Ever since that semester I have continued to "play with" and use computers in my personal life (managing my finances, automating the process of turning my school notes into beautiful pdfs, etc.).

While working as an intern, I realized there were certain repetitive tasks that were taking up tons of time. I knew that the tools I had learned in class could automate these tasks but I did not always know enough of the language/tool to figure things out. I began "working at home"; I would spend some time at home learning more about some of the tools I knew about. Further, I discovered new tools and ways to improve my scripts. I even wrote scripts to automate my scripts. I began to realize that having these skills was greatly beneficial to me in my career.

This all leads to me typing these words in a **markdown** file which uses **jekyll** to convert the markdown to **html**. Jekyll reads all of the files (**YAML**, **SCCS**, and **JavaScript**) in this **repository** which is hosted on **GitHub** through GitHub **Pages**. I am typing this in my preferred texted editor called **neovim** which is a fork of **vim** (which is a fork of **vi**).

This website will act as a place for me to showcase some of the ways that I use my computer skills to be more efficient at work as well as a place for me put my skill, qualifications, etc.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. **What motivated you to pursue Civil Engineering?**
   **Answer**:
   My last two years of high school I began to take math seriously and found that I enjoyed it and was not too bad at it. I did not know what type of engineer I wanted to be, but I knew I should pursue engineering. Unsure of which to choose from&mdash;electrical, mechanical, or civil (or computer science)&mdash;I randomly decided on civil engineering. I really enjoyed the classes and just never had a reason to switch. 

### 2. **How do you balance working full-time with pursuing your degree?**
   **Answer**:
   Balancing a full-time job with studying has been a challenge, but it's also a rewarding experience. I prioritize time management, break tasks into smaller chunks, and stay organized. I leverage my skills in automation and scripting to simplify repetitive tasks, which frees up time for studying. Online learning has also given me the flexibility to learn at my own pace which allows me to balance my work, school, and personal life.

### 3. **What coding languages are you most comfortable with, and why?**
   **Answer**:
   I’m most comfortable with **bash** and **python**. They allow me to efficiently address problems I face in my work. For example, **bash** is great for automating repetitive tasks, while **python** has been great for data analysis. I constantly seek to improve my knowledge of new programming languages and frameworks to stay adaptable in a rapidly evolving technical landscape. I am currently playing around with golang (Go). I am attracted to Go's speed and the fact that I can make my scripts into a portable binary is huge to share my scripts with coworkers who may not have the same coding knowledge as myself.

### 4. **What types of automation projects have you worked on?**
   **Answer**:
   To see what types of automation project I have worked on, please go to my [Projects](/projects) page. To give a quick summary: I’ve worked on several automation projects to improve my daily tasks, such as:
   - **Automating data analysis** using scripts that collect and process data from multiple sources.
   - **Automating system monitoring tasks** on my WSL machine using custom bash scripts
   - **Integrating tools** that connect different software applications to eliminate manual data entry and reduce errors

### 5. **How do you stay updated with new technologies in the engineering field?**
   **Answer**:
   I regularly follow engineering blogs and participate in online communities. I also take free online courses. I understand that technology is constantly changing and that it is impossible to stay up-to-date on everything, and thats why I do my best to stay ahead on technologies that directly affect me in my personal life and at work.

### 6. **How has GitHub helped you in your professional development?**
   **Answer**:
   GitHub has been an extremly helpful tool for organizing and showcasing my work. It allows me to share my projects and track progress. By regularly updating my GitHub with new projects and contributions, I demonstrate my commitment to improving my skills and sharing knowledge. It also gives me the opportunity to receive feedback, learn from others, and stay motivated.

### 7. **What are your long-term career goals?**
   **Answer**:
   My long-term career goal is to integrate my technical skills with my engineering expertise to work meaningful projects that have positive impacts on the world. I hope to contribute to sustainable engineering practices, make data-driven decisions, and automate complex processes. I also aim to become a leader in my field, using my diverse skills to mentor others.

### 8. **How do you use Microsoft Excel in your daily work?**
   **Answer**:
   Anyone who knows my opinion on proprietary software will know that I am not a fan. Large products like excel, word, and powerpoint are never my go-to in my personal life. With that being said, I understand that they are the industry standard&mdash;I work with Excel spreadsheets everyday. I know Microsoft Excel is a powerful tool. I have used Excel's advanced functions such as **VLOOKUP**, **INDEX/MATCH**, and **PivotTables** to process and analyze large datasets. Additionally, I create customized templates and automate reporting processes using VBA and macros to save time and improve accuracy.

### 9. **What makes you unique as an Engineering Technician?**
   **Answer**:
   What sets me apart is my ability to bridge the gap between engineering and technology. I don't just rely on traditional tools and methods; I constantly seek innovative solutions by integrating scripting, automation, and coding into my workflow. This makes me more efficient, helps me solve problems faster, and allows me to create custom solutions that enhance the overall performance of my team and projects.
