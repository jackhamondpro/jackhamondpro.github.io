# Jack Hamond’s Engineering Technician Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, where I showcase how I use my computer skills combined with my technical skills as an engineering technician to be more effective at work.

## Tech Stack

I have used many tools in the creation of this website including:

* **Jekyll**: Jekyll is a static site generator that takes your content (written in markdown or HTML), processes it, and generates a static website. It allows you to easily manage content, create blog posts, and organize pages without the need for complex backend infrastructure. Jekyll is integrated with GitHub Pages, making it an ideal choice for hosting static websites directly from a GitHub repository.
* **Sass (SCCS)**: In this project, I use Sass (SCSS) for styling, which is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of regular CSS. Sass allows us to use advanced features like variables, nested rules, mixins, and inheritance to create cleaner and more organized stylesheets.
* **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used in this project to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website. While Jekyll generates static HTML pages, JavaScript allows me to implement features that go beyond basic content display such as the "Toggle Theme" button's functionality.
* **GitHub Pages**: GitHub Pages is used to host and deploy this project. It is a free service provided by GitHub to publish static websites directly from a repository. With GitHub Pages, you can host your Jekyll website without the need for an external server or complex deployment process.
